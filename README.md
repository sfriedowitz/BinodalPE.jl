# BinodalPE.jl

BinodalPE implements thermodynamic models (i.e. free energy functions) that allow for determination
of binodal coexistence conditions for polyelectrolyte solutions and coacervates.

Solving the binodal coexistence condition for a given model 
amounts to equating the electrochemical potentials of all species
and the osmotic pressure between the phases, overall mass balance by the lever rule, 
and charge neutrality in each macroscopic phase.

## Models

The package implements a series of `AbstractModel`s
that describe a specific physical system and free energy function.
Four main models are available:
1. `SinglePolyion` - A solution consisting of a single polyelectrolyte (A), counterions (+), and coions (-),
where the counterions can reversibly bind along the PE chain
2. `SymmetricCoacervate` - A solution consisting of a single "polymer" density (P) and a single "salt" density (S)
3. `AsymmetricCoacervate` - A solution with explicit treatment of polyanions (A), polycations (C), cations (+), and anions (-)
4. `AssociationCoacervate` - Same species as in an asymmetric coacervate, but with a thermodynamic description of local charge binding
This includes cation binding on the polyanions, anion binding along the polycations,
and interchain cross-linking betweeen the polyelectrolytes

Each model depends on numerous parameters that describe
the structural and energetic properties of salt and polyelectrolyte species,
including polymer chain lengths, charge densities, and monomer volumes.
These include: 
* `omega` - The normalized monomer volume of a species
* `sig` - The linear charge density of a polymer
* `chi` - The Flory-Huggins parameter between polymer and solvent
* `dp` - The degree of polymerization of a polymer
* `b` - The normalized segment length of a polymer
* `lp` - The reference persistence length of a semi-flexible polymer (only used for worm-like chains)
* `dg` - Short-range binding energy for models with reversible binding (`SinglePolyion` and `AssociationCoacervate`)

The electrostatic free energy within a model
depends on the conformational properties of the polyelectrolytes.
It is mandatory to specify an `AbstractChainStructure` when constructing a model
that specifies the structure factor of the polymers used within the electrostatic free energy.
Available chain structures include:
* `PointLike` - A Debye-Huckel description of point-like ions
* `ExtendedPoint` - The extended Debye-Huckel description for point-like ions
* `SmearedPoint` - A Debye-Huckel model for point-like ions with density smearing to regularize electrostatic interactions
* `GaussianCoil` - A flexible Gaussian coil described by the Debye function
* `RodLike` - A rigid, rod-like chain described by the Neugebauer function
* `WormLike` - A semiflexible, worm-like chain with an interpolated structure factor depending on the persistence length `lp`
* `SphericalGlobule` - A collapsed, globular polyelectrolyte
* `AdaptiveChain` - A worm-like chain with adaptively determined persistence length based on the RGF formalism (not available in all models)

## Usage

The general usage of this code is to:
1. Construct a model with a given set of parameters
2. Specify an initial bulk solution composition and initial guess for the compositions of coexisting phases
3. Sweep over a range of relevant parameters and solve for phase coexistence
with the `bndlsolve` or `bndlminimize` methods

This workflow is enabled by a series of general methods
implemented for each model, including 
`ftotal(phi, model)` which returns the free energy at a given composition `phi`,
`mutotal(phi, model)` which returns the chemical potential of each species evaluated at `phi`,
and `f2total(phi, model)` which returns the Hessian of the free energy evaluated at `phi`.

Additionally, for `SinglePolyion` and `AssociationCoacervate` models,
or any model with an `AdaptiveChain` structure specified,
one can solve for a set of internal state variables at a specified composition.
These may include binding fractions for reversible, short-range ion binding,
or the adaptively determined persistence length of an adaptive chain.
The internal solver routine for each model is implemented in the method `varsolve(phi, model)`.

Examples of these general procedures are shown below.

### Construct a model

```julia
julia> using BinodalPE 

julia> model_single = SinglePolyion(structure = GaussianCoil, omega = [5, 5, 1], dp = 100, sig = 1.0, dg = -5)

julia> model_symm = SymmetricCoacervate(structure = RodLike, omega = [5, 1], dp = 1000, sig = 0.5)

julia> modle_asymm = AsymmetricCoacervate(structure = WormLike, omega = [5, 5, 1, 1], dp = [100, 100], sig = [0.5, 0.5], lp = [10, 10])

julia> model_assoc = AssociationCoacervate(structure = AdaptiveChain, omega = [5, 5, 1, 1], dp = [100, 100], dg = [-4, -4, -8])
```

### Evaluate a model
